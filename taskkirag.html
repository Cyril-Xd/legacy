<title>Task Manager kira method GoGuardian</title>
</head>
<body>
This method is similar to the spam method but <br>
differs in the fact that it crashes GoGuardian <br>
gor a period of 20 minutes. <br>
The procedure is: open task manager, click GoGuardian, <br>
Press enter to end it, click Utility : Network <br>
Services, repeatedly end this. <br>
Utility : Network Services has a refresh rate of <br>
one second so it must be spammed quickly. <br>
This method was devised by me in September 2019 <br>
This was my most popular exploit and was claimed <br>
to be created by many people.
