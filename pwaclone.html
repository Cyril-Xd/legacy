Progressive Web Apps and cloning<br>
Progressive Web Apps are a special kind of<br>
app that can be installed on a chromebook <br>
even when apps are not allowed. It is very <br>
easy to make one, I will not detail it here <br>
as google is a thing. This website is built <br>
as both a PWA and a clone.<br>
A clone is a simple copy hosted on a different <br>
url. Many websites can be cloned. All you do <br>
is open the site, open dev tools, and go to <br>
sources and save and rehost all the files there.<br>
Some modification may be needed.
